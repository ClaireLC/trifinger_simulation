# NOTE: for some reason that is not clear to me, `pip install` of required
# packages (sphinx, etc.) was installing things to a weird location outside of
# PATH when the repo is checked out directly in the working dir.  The
# corresponding warning from pip:
#
#     WARNING: The scripts sphinx-apidoc, sphinx-autogen, sphinx-build and
#     sphinx-quickstart are installed in
#     '/home/runner/.local/lib/trifinger_simulation' which is not on PATH
#
# This resulted in the build to fail later one, as sphinx-build was not in the
# PATH.
#
# This is solved by checking out to a subdirectory "trifinger_simulation".
